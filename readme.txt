this file contains 7 programs and has example videos  

1.Sequence Generator code and Executable file

1.1 it generates different gene mutation of the given gene by replacing each nucleotide one at a time. 
1.2 Each neucleotide is replaced with 3 other nucleotides and 1 combination of absense of any nucleotide.
1.3 both code and exe file is present for use
1.4 first line asks the length of the protein
1.5 then gene is entered without any spaces

2.Probability shading code

2.1 downloads the probability_shading images of the gene
2.2 multiple genes can be given all at the same time
2.3 saves the images in a specific format 000000.ps 
2.4 for eaxample 178006.ps means probability_shading image of the 178th gene at 6 degree Centigrade
    005098.ps means probability_shading image of the 5th at 98 degree Centigrade

3.Identity shading code

3.1 downloads the identity_shading images of the gene
3.2 multiple genes can be given all at the same time
3.3 saves the images in a specific format 000000.ids 
3.4 for eaxample 178006.ids means identity_shading image of the 178th gene at 6 degree Centigrade
    005098.ids means identity_shading image of the 5th at 98 degree Centigrade
    
4.Melt_profile code

4.1 downloads the Melt_profile images of the gene
4.2 multiple genes can be given all at the same time
4.3 saves the images in a specific format 0 00_00
4.4 for eaxample 1 25_50 means Melt_profile images of the 1th gene from 25 degree Centigrade to 50 degree centigrade
    
       
5.Python Programs for 2 MATLAB codes
5.1 First Code keeps k parameter constant and varies a and T parameters.
5.2 Second Code keeps a parameter constant and varies k and T parameters.
5.3 In both codes Four Different graphs are plotted.
5.4 These are Response Curve, Gain Profile, Peak Gain vs Threshold Curve , Plot of g_{max} and (1/T_{Th})^2

6.Matlab video making code 


important Downloads

--- pip install selenium (command)
--- download chromedriver and put it in this path "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver" in windows 
--- for mac the path in the code needs to be changed to the location where the chromedriver is put       
--- for windows the images are stored in C:\Users\Admin
